Overview
--------

In this project, you will install the software for all your projects and build a very simple "Hello World App" using Ruby on Rails.

All the steps for the creation of your first app are available in the tutorial, Development Environment Setup and First App, under Week 1 of the [Recitations]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/recitations).

Deliverables
------------

**Checklist items.** You should include in this project:

*   Code: Your application code must be uploaded to your repository.
*   Heroku: Your application must be running on Heroku. Make sure you have included the URL of your application in the README.md file which you submit along with your code.
*   GitHub Pull Request: Make sure you submit a "Pull Request" on GitHub so that your TAs know that you have uploaded your code.

Hints
-----

**Get going early**. We very strongly recommend that you get going as soon as you can, so you can get help from the teaching staff and from your colleagues using the Piazza forum, and make good use of the lab hours over the weekend. Whatever you do, do not leave work until the night of the deadline!

**Refer to Week 2 of the Recitations**. The recitation tutorial covers details on how to use GIT and GitHub; it can save you a lot of time.
